#Script for trimming and adpater removal

#Trimns: Trim consecutive Ns from the 5’ and 3’ termini. If quality trimming is also enabled (--trimqualities), then stretches of mixed low-quality bases and/or Ns are trimmed.
#Trimqualities: Trim consecutive stretches of low quality bases (threshold set by --minquality) from the 5’ and 3’ termini. If trimming of Ns is also enabled (--trimns), then stretches of mixed low-quality bases and Ns are trimmed.
#minquality: Set the threshold for trimming low quality bases using --trimqualities and --trimwindows. Default is 2
#collapse: In paired-end mode, merge overlapping mates into a single and recalculate the quality scores. In single-end mode, attempt to identify templates for which the entire sequence is available. In both cases, complete “collapsed” reads are written with a ‘M_’ name prefix, and “collapsed” reads which are trimmed due to quality settings are written with a ‘MT_’ name prefix.
#adapterlist: Read one or more adapter sequences from a table. The first two columns (separated by whitespace) of each line in the file are expected to correspond to values passed to –adapter1 and –adapter2.
#minlength: Reads shorter than this length are discarded following trimming. Defaults to 15Reads shorter than this length are discarded following trimming. Defaults to 15.
